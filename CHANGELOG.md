  - CPU usage reduced significantly

- **GPU memory and performance optimizations** (#146, #145) - 2025-10-15
  - Eliminated redundant GPU tensor copy in detection processor (#115)
  - Single GPU copy (1.5ms) instead of double copy (3ms) - 50% improvement
  - Optimized buffer memory tracking with incremental calculation (#116)

- **Client timeout and stability fixes** (#144, #143) - 2025-10-15
  - Prevent client timeout on JPEG encoding failures (#113)
  - Return cached frame on encoding error instead of breaking stream
  - Medium priority bug fixes batch 2 (#107, #110, #111, #112):
    - YOLOX model loading with retry logic (exponential backoff)
    - Safe cleanup of failed cameras (queue emptying, resource cleanup)
    - Active camera validation (prevents startup with 0 cameras)
    - Shared coordinator memory leak (bounded deque for metrics)

- **High-priority bug fixes** (#129) - 2025-10-15
  - GPU device string comparison causing unnecessary GPUâ†’GPU transfers (10-20ms improvement)
  - Missing frame validation after cv2.resize() preventing web server crashes
  - Queue overflow observability with drop rate tracking (drops/sec and overall %)
  - VideoWriter failure resource leaks (cleanup of partial video files)
  - Input size validation for aspect ratio and model compatibility
  - Config hot-reload race condition with copy-on-write pattern

  - Thread orphaning with enhanced timeout error logging (WARNINGâ†’ERROR level)
  - FFmpeg zombie processes on failed termination (proper wait() after kill())
