# Notes for annotation:
# - telescope_ota: The main telescope tube body
# - telescope_mount: The mount head that holds the telescope
# - tripod_leg: Individual tripod legs (critical for collision detection)
# - counterweight: The counterweight shaft and weights
# - telescope_cover: Any covers protecting the telescope
# - finder_scope: Small finder telescope
# - focuser: The focusing mechanism on the telescope
